One of my early forays into building a blog-style site using [Jekyll] (https://jekyllrb.com/)

Demonstrates use of [Liquid] (https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) templating engine for producing dynamic menus and content.

Adapts the blog paradigm (there - I said it!) to producing a dynamic photo gallery.
